\section{Canny filter and hysteresis}

Hysteresis is defined by two thresholds: $\beta_1, \beta_2$ with $\beta_1 > \beta_2$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item All points $< \beta_2$ are rejected.
    \item All points $> \beta_1$ are kept.
    \item The points between $\beta_2$ and $\beta_1$ are kept if they form a long enough chain.
\end{itemize}
