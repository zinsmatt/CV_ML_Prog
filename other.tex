\subsection{Canny filter and hysteresis}

Hysteresis is defined by two thresholds: $\beta_1, \beta_2$ with $\beta_1 > \beta_2$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item All points $< \beta_2$ are rejected.
    \item All points $> \beta_1$ are kept.
    \item The points between $\beta_2$ and $\beta_1$ are kept if they form a long enough chain.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Properties of symmetric matrices}
A symmetric matrix $S$ ($S = S^T$) has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ has \textbf{only real} eigenvalues.
    \item is called \textbf{positive semi-definite} if $x^TSx \leq 0, \forall x$
    \item is called \textbf{positive definite} if $x^TSx > 0, \forall x \neq 0$
    \item all its eigenvectors associated to different eigenvalues are \textbf{orthogonal}
    \item is positive (semi)-definite, if all eigenvalues are positive (non negative).
\end{itemize}
